						<p>Hi!  I'm Jessica Otte.  I'm a software developer located in Northern California.  I got my Computer Science degree from Chico State in 2008 and have been coding ever since.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Why computer science?  My dad was a software developer for 30+ years, and loved his job.  He always spoke so highly of it that it piqued my interest.  I wanted to find out what it meant to be a "software developer", so once I got to college I decided to take a couple computer classes.  Immediately I understood why my dad enjoyed it: it's like solving puzzles.  There is something incredibly satisfying about being able to come up with a solution to a problem.  </p>
						<br />
						<p>I've worked at two different companies since I graduated college, one making medical management software and one making data center infrastructure management software.  Because both applications have a java backend, I tend to consider myself a Java Developer since that's where most of my experience has been.  But that doesn't mean I can only code in Java.  I also love writing SQL queries, and have taken a few classes on Code School and TreeHouse to gain exposure to new technologies and other languages. </p>

						<p>I am a very content person, and enjoy the simple things in life.  Going to the gym, spending time with family, and reading are some of my favorite pastimes.  One of the best books I read recently was <a href='https://books.google.com/books/about/Stumbling_on_Happiness.html?id=6h8jkUBC4asC&source=kp_cover&hl=en' target='_blank'>Stumbling on Happiness</a>, which basically explained why humans aren't very good at predicting what will make them happy.  It was an absolutely fascinating book and I highly recommend it! </p>

							<p>A couple years ago I tried scuba diving, loved it, and immediately got certified.  There's a whole other world under the water, and it's amazing.  My favorite place to dive so far is St. Croix.</p>
